WP-Easy-Custom-Login
====================

Custom login screen automatically created from the logo and custom background set for the site.

##Usage
Based on the Login Logo by Mark Jaquith https://wordpress.org/plugins/login-logo/.

This plugin will grab the `logo.png` file from within your active theme's images folder (a common set up for Genesis Child themes) and set it as the login logo. 

The plugin will also check to see if you have a custom background (`add_theme_support( 'custome-background' )`) set and use the settings there for the login screen background.
